    <h1>My favorite places</h1>

    <p>We chose these places beause they are all unique in their own way. There is a variety of cultures we are intersted in. Dana's favorite place is her home she created here in Oregon. On her spare time she loves to enjoy her days with her children exploring. Which entails hiking, bike riding and finding peace in nature. Doris' favorite place is Palm Springs. The desert is one of her favorite places beacuse it is her home town. It is complete opposite to Oregon weather. It is hot and dry. Full of palm trees and sunshine. She like to lay out and sunbathe like a lizzard. As to the other places we have chosen they are nice destinations to visit. We highly recommend you take a well needed vacation to one of these lovely places. </p>
